Sure! Here's a sample README file for the code you provided:

YouTube Web Scraper

This is a Python Flask application that scrapes YouTube video information based on a provided URL. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the webpage, retrieves relevant data, and stores it in a CSV file and a MongoDB database.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1.Python 3.x

2.Flask

3.Flask-CORS

4.Selenium

5.BeautifulSoup

6.PyMongo

You also need to have Google Chrome installed on your system as the code uses the Chrome web driver.

Installation

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git

2.Change into the project directory: cd your_repository

3.Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the Flask application: python app.py

1.Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the home page.

2.Enter the YouTube URL in the provided input field and click the "Submit" button.

3.The application will scrape the video information from the YouTube page and store it in a CSV file named scrapper.csv.

4.The scraped data will also be inserted into a MongoDB database named info_scrap in the collection info_scrap_data.

Notes

1.The code is currently set to scrape information for a maximum of 5 videos from the provided YouTube URL. You can change this limit by modifying the min(5, len(titles)) line in the code.

2.Make sure to update the MongoDB connection URI (uri) in the code with your own URI. You can obtain this URI from your MongoDB Atlas account.

3.The CSV file will be overwritten each time the code is run. If you want to append new data to the existing file instead, change the file mode from "w" to "a" in the open() function.

4.This code is provided as a basic example and may require additional error handling and optimization for production use.
